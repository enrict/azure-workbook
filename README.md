# Azure Workbook - July 2021 Edition

As I am learning the fundamentals of Azure, I am creating this workbook to help me study for the AZ-900 (Azure Fundamentals) certification.

This workbook is suitable for use alongside Microsoft Learn's Azure Fundamentals free online course, as it helps you understand Azure and cloud computing as a whole.

This workbook covers the updated material required for the AZ-900 examination as of July 2021.

This PDF will be editable and also print-ready to accomodate both online and written-based learning.
